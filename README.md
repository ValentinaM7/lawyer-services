This website is a fictional law firm showcase created to demonstrate some of my web development skills. It features a modern, professional design with sections showing services, contact forms (not functional yet), and FAQ. The site highlights responsive layout, clean navigation, and dynamic content rendering using SASS and Bootsrap. Although the firm is not real, the project illustrates my ability to design and build functional, visually appealing websites tailored to professional industries.
